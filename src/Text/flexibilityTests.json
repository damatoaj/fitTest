            "The subject sits without shoes and the soles of the feet flat against a sit-and-reach bo with the zero mark at the 26 cm. Inner edges of the soles should be 6 in (15.2cm) apart.",
            "The subject should reach forward with both hands as far as possible, holding this position for roughly 2 seconds. Be sure that the participant keeps the hands parallel and does not lead with one hand, or bounce. Fingertips can be overlapped and should be in contact with the measuring portion or yardstick of the sit-and-reach box.",
            "The score is the most distant point reached with the fingertips. The best of two trials should be recorded. To assist with the best attempt, the subject should exhale and drop the head between the arms when reahing. Testers should ensure that the knees of the participant stay extended; however the tester should not push the knees down to the floor. The subject should not hold their breath at any time."
